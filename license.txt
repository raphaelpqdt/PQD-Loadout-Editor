                             OVERVIEW
================================================================================

PQD Loadout Editor is a comprehensive loadout customization and management

loadouts directly from the deploy/respawn menu.

- Data persistence between sessions


================================================================================

   - When selecting a PQD slot, the player spawns with the configured loadout
